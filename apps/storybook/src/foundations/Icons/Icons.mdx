# Icons

They by default, do not have a `width` or `height` set, but the default viewBox is set to `0 0 20 20` which means they
will scale to fit the parent container whatever that may be. The default `fill` is `currentColor` meaning they will
inherit the `color` of the parent container. It's not advised to overwrite the `viewBox` property.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Icon } from '@repo/ui';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <Icon name="ArrowForwared" className="text-red-700" />;
};
```

## All Icons

<Canvas of={IconsStories.All} />
