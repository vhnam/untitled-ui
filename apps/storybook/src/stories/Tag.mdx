## Overview

Tags are used to give a quick information about a performed action. Tags can be added or removed from a page or another
component. They are also used as a filter.

**Best practices**

- Tags text should be concise and easily scannable.
- Tags text should be explicit and indicate its purpose.
- Tags should be very close to or within the performed action.
- Use Badge component if the information given is not related to a performed action.

## Imports

```js
import { Tag } from "@repo/ui";
```

## Usage

Tags are used to give a quick and short scannable information to the users. They are mostly filled with numbers or a
single word.
