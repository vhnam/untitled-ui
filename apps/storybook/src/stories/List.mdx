- [Usage](#usage)

## Overview

Lists are used to give a quick information about a performed action. Lists can be added or removed from a page or another
component. They are also used as a filter.

**Best practices**

- Lists text should be concise and easily scannable.
- Lists text should be explicit and indicate its purpose.
- Lists should be very close to or within the performed action.
- Use Badge component if the information given is not related to a performed action.

## Imports

```js
import { List } from '@repo/ui';
```

## Usage

Lists are related to a performed action. They should be very close by the action's trigger. Moreover, a tag can be added or removed from that place. They cannot exist on their own.
