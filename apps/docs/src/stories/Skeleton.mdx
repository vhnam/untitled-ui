# Skeleton

- [Overview](#overview)
- [Usage](#usage)

## Overview

Display a placeholder preview of your content before the data gets loaded to reduce load-time frustration.

## Imports

```js
import { Skeleton } from '@repo/ui';
```

## Usage

- Use a skeleton the first time a user waits for content to load.
- Skeletons work well when the wait times are short and the content is predictable.
- They're also helpful when some parts of the screen are already available (cached) from a previous session, and the other parts still need to load. This allows users to begin reading content until the rest is available.
