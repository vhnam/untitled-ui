## Overview

Dividers are one way to visually group components and create hierarchy. They can also be used to imply nested parent/child relationships.

## Imports

```js
import { Divider } from '@repo/ui';
```

## Usage

Use full width dividers to separate larger sections of unrelated content. They can be used directly on a surface or inside other components like cards or lists.
